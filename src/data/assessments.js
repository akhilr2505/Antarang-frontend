        question: "Select the figure that logically completes the pattern: If a wheel has 8 spokes, how many spaces are there between the spokes?",
        options: [
          { letter: "A", text: "7 spaces", weight: 0 },
          { letter: "B", text: "8 spaces", weight: 1 }, // Correct
          { letter: "C", text: "9 spaces", weight: 0 },
          { letter: "D", text: "16 spaces", weight: 0 }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "B",
        explanation: "Since the wheel is circular, the spokes radiate from the center to the edge. The number of spaces between spokes is equal to the number of spokes, which is 8."

        question: "A training batch has 60 students. If the ratio of students interested in Technology to those interested in Healthcare is 3:2, how many students prefer Technology?",

          { letter: "D", text: "30 students", weight: 0 }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "A",
        explanation: "Total parts in ratio = 3 + 2 = 5 parts. Value of each part = 60 / 5 = 12 students. Tech students = 3 parts * 12 = 36 students."
